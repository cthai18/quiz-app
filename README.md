# quiz-app

A Simple Quiz App 

run these two commands in quiz-app directory to install necessary dependencies:
npm install
npm run frontend-install

run these two commands to start the app:  
npm run server  
npm run frontend

(MongoDB Atlas can take a bit to connect to, so if the page errors that it can't connect to localhost:5000, just refresh the page)

I didn't have time to implement: users(and auth), or the play component.
