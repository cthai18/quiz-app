(MongoDB Atlas can take a bit to connect to, so if the page errors that it can't connect to localhost:5000, just refresh the page)

You might have to whitelist your ip address in mongodb atlas to connect to it. Just login online, go to Network Access on the left bar, then add the ip address that shows up when you google what's my ip address.
